The last project I used bootstrap is the website I made with Gatsby. </p>\n\n<p>But most of the time, I use only the responsive classes in bootstrap. The <code>bootstrap.css</code> file itself is 152 kb in size. I had to find a way to remove unnecessary CSS from the code. I was using bootstrap from the first version of this website. I didn't want to change. </p>\n\n<p>So, I used <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-purgecss\">gatsby-plugin-purgecss</a> to remove unnecessary CSS from the production build.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YakUdcBN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/u57ay3h7k3ki1ljg0qez.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YakUdcBN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/u57ay3h7k3ki1ljg0qez.png\" alt=\"Build Screenshot\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Even though this is NOT an install and forget type plugin (mentioned in their documentation), for my website, adding to the <code>gatsby-config.js</code> file did a good job.</p>\n\n","url":"https://dev.to/ctrleffive/how-i-purged-95-of-unused-bootstrap-css-from-my-gatsby-website-3khi"}}}}
